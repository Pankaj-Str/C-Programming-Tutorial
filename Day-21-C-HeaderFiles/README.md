# C Header Files

Header files in C are an essential part of code organization and reusability. They allow you to declare functions, data structures, and macros that can be used in multiple source files. Header files are typically separate from source files and contain declarations and prototypes.

## Purpose of Header Files

Header files serve several important purposes:

1. **Declaration of Functions and Data Structures**: Header files declare functions, data types, and macros that can be used across multiple source files, promoting code reusability.

2. **Encapsulation**: Header files hide the implementation details of functions and data structures, allowing the user to interact with them using the provided interface while keeping the implementation hidden.

3. **Organization**: Header files help organize your code by separating declarations from implementation, making it easier to maintain and navigate.

## Common Header Files

### Standard Library Headers

C provides a set of standard library headers that contain the declarations for standard functions and data types. Some common ones include:

- `<stdio.h>`: Declarations for input and output functions like `printf` and `scanf`.
- `<stdlib.h>`: Declarations for memory allocation functions like `malloc` and `free`.
- `<string.h>`: Declarations for string manipulation functions like `strcpy` and `strlen`.
- `<math.h>`: Declarations for mathematical functions like `sqrt` and `sin`.

### User-Defined Header Files

You can create your own header files to encapsulate functionality and data structures. User-defined header files are typically placed in your project directory or a designated include directory.

## Creating and Using Header Files

Here's how to create and use header files:

### Creating a Header File

1. Create a new file with a `.h` extension, e.g., `myheader.h`.
2. Declare functions, data types, and macros in the header file, e.g.:

```c
#ifndef MYHEADER_H
#define MYHEADER_H

void myFunction(int param1, int param2);
int globalVariable;

#endif
```

The `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif` directives are used to prevent the header file from being included multiple times.

### Using a Header File

In your source code, include the header file using `#include`:

```c
#include "myheader.h"
```

Now you can use the functions, data types, and macros declared in `myheader.h`.

## Example

Let's create a simple header file and use it in a C program:

**myheader.h**:

```c
#ifndef MYHEADER_H
#define MYHEADER_H

void greet(char *name);

#endif
```

**main.c**:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "myheader.h"

int main() {
    greet("Alice");
    greet("Bob");
    return 0;
}

void greet(char *name) {
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);
}
```

In this example:

- We create a header file `myheader.h` containing a function declaration for `greet`.
- In the `main.c` source file, we include `myheader.h` and define the `greet` function.

## Conclusion

Header files in C are essential for organizing code, encapsulating functionality, and enabling code reusability. By creating clear and well-structured header files, you can build modular and maintainable programs, allowing you to separate the declaration of functions and data structures from their implementation.
