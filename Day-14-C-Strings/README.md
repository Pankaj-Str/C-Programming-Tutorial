# Day 14: C Strings

Welcome to Day 14 of the C Programming series. Today, we'll delve into the world of C strings. In C, strings are not a built-in data type like in some other languages. Instead, strings are typically represented as arrays of characters. Let's explore how strings work in C, including how to declare, initialize, manipulate, and work with them.

## What Are C Strings?

In C, a string is a sequence of characters stored in an array, terminated by a null character (`'\0'`). The null character marks the end of the string. For example, the string "Hello" is represented as an array of characters: `'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'`.

## Declaring and Initializing Strings

Strings in C can be declared and initialized in various ways:

1. **Array of Characters:** You can declare a character array (string) and initialize it with a string literal. For example:

   ```c
   char str[] = "Hello";
   ```

2. **Character Pointer:** You can declare a character pointer and make it point to a string literal. For example:

   ```c
   char *str = "Hello";
   ```

   Note that when you use a character pointer, the string is stored in a read-only section of memory. Modifying it directly can lead to undefined behavior.

3. **Initialization with Individual Characters:** You can initialize an array of characters character by character. For example:

   ```c
   char str[6];
   str[0] = 'H';
   str[1] = 'e';
   str[2] = 'l';
   str[3] = 'l';
   str[4] = 'o';
   str[5] = '\0';
   ```

All these approaches result in a character array representing the string "Hello." The array includes the null character to signify the end of the string.

## Accessing Characters in a String

You can access individual characters in a string using array subscript notation:

```c
char str[] = "Hello";
char firstChar = str[0]; // firstChar now contains 'H'
```

Keep in mind that C arrays are 0-based, so the index `0` represents the first character.

## String Functions in C Standard Library

C provides a set of standard library functions for working with strings. Some of the most commonly used string functions include:

- `strlen`: Returns the length of a string.
- `strcpy`: Copies one string to another.
- `strcat`: Concatenates two strings.
- `strcmp`: Compares two strings.
- `strchr`: Searches for the first occurrence of a character in a string.
- `strstr`: Searches for the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

Here's an example of using the `strlen` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char str[] = "Hello, World!";
    int length = strlen(str); // length is 13
    printf("Length of the string: %d\n", length);
    return 0;
}
```

You can explore other string functions in the C standard library to perform various string manipulations.

## Input and Output of Strings

When reading strings from the standard input or a file, you can use functions like `fgets` to read a line of text. Here's an example of reading a line of text from the user:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char str[100]; // Declare a character array to store the input

    printf("Enter a string: ");
    fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin); // Read a line of text from the user

    printf("You entered: %s", str); // Print the input

    return 0;
}
```

When displaying strings, you can use the `%s` format specifier with functions like `printf`.

## Manipulating Strings

Strings in C can be manipulated by iterating through characters and modifying them. For example, you can reverse a string:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void reverseString(char *str) {
    int length = strlen(str);
    for (int i = 0, j = length - 1; i < j; i++, j--) {
        char temp = str[i];
        str[i] = str[j];
        str[j] = temp;
    }
}

int main() {
    char str[] = "Hello";
    reverseString(str);
    printf("Reversed string: %s\n", str); // Output: "olleH"
    return 0;
}
```

You can create custom functions to manipulate strings based on your specific requirements.

## Character Arrays vs. Character Pointers

While character arrays and character pointers can both be used to represent strings, they have subtle differences. Character arrays store the string content directly in memory, whereas character pointers point to the string content. Here's a key difference:

1. **Character Arrays:** The string content is stored in the array, so you can modify it directly.

   ```c
   char str[] = "Hello";
   str[0] = 'h'; // Valid, modifies the string
   ```

2. **Character Pointers:** The string content is typically stored in read-only memory, so modifying it directly is undefined behavior.

   ```c
   char *str = "Hello";
   str[0] = 'h'; // Invalid, may lead to undefined behavior
   ```

When using character pointers, it's best to treat the string as read-only or make a copy of it if you need to modify the content.

## Working with Dynamic Memory

If you need to work with strings of variable length or modify the contents of a string, you can allocate memory dynamically using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, and `realloc`. Remember to free the allocated memory using `free` when you're done to prevent memory leaks.

Here's an example of dynamically allocating memory for a string:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char *dynamicString = (char *)malloc(100); // Allocate memory for a string
    if (dynamicString == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    snprintf(dynamicString, 100, "Dynamically allocated string");
    printf("Dynamic string: %s\n", dynamicString);

    free(dynamicString); // Deallocate the allocated memory

    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

C strings are an essential part of C programming, allowing you to work with text data and perform a wide range of string manipulations. Whether you're dealing with character arrays or character pointers, understanding how strings work and how to use them effectively is crucial for C programmers.
