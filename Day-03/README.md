## Assignment 6
Prompt the user to input their first and last name and then print them a welcome message. Try storing the input as a char variable's value.

Easy Mode: Allocate an arbitrary amount of indices to your char array and pray to the gods that the user input fits.

Extra Credit: Dynamically allocate the array size of your char variable based on the length of the user's input.

## Example Output
```terminal_session
Enter your first name: Jimmy
Enter your last name: Smith
Hello Jimmy Smith!
```
